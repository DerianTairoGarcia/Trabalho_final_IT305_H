A Rule-based EMS (RBEMS), which is typically found in microgrid controllers nowadays, and an implementation of an Optimization-based EMS (OBEMS), which is not usual in today’s controllers, are proposed, tested, and demonstrated in the microgrid testbed. The RBEMS consists of a state machine that represents the commitment of different genset units in the system and the curtailment of load and renewable generation. The OBEMS is based on a unit commitment model for microgrids that minimizes the generation and curtailment costs, while operating the microgrid equipment according to technical limits. Both EMS systems are integrated into a Python application which integrates various open-source packages and solvers, making it affordable, flexible and easy to replicate and upgrade. The successful implementation and performance of the EMS is discussed, showing that the components of the microgrid follow the dispatch commands, with the OBEMS yielding better overall results than the RBEMS, as expected, using the existing communications links and maintaining the stability of the microgrid.}

abstract = {With the increasing proportion of electric vehicles in the automobile market, the negative impact of vehicle’s charging on the power system is gradually increasing. The charging-discharging model of vehicles and the multi-objective optimization model of the load dispatch for the microgrid are established. By combining gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a hybrid modified GSA-PSO (MGSA-PSO) scheme is proposed to optimize the load dispatch of the microgrid containing electric vehicles. To improve the global search performance of the GSA algorithm, the proposed scheme introduces the global memory capacity of the PSO into the GSA. At the same time, the hybrid algorithm is improved by designing adaptive inertia vector, learning factor and chaotic initialization population. The load dispatch optimization are implemented and analyzed, including the unordered charging strategy, the ordered charging-discharging strategy, and the ordered charging-discharging strategy with distributed generations. The optimization results show that, under the same weight factor, the ordered charging-discharging strategy can reduce 13.38% of the total cost, 78.77% of the microgrid load variance and improve the safety and economy of the grid. In addition, reasonable scheduling of distributed power output power can further reduce the total cost by 14.06% and the load variance by 22.36%. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is proved by analyzing the influences of different numbers of electric vehicles and different charging models.}

Firstly, this paper constructs the mathematical models of related equipment in IES, electric vehicles (EVs), and the uncertainty of renewable energy output. Secondly, a multi-objective distributed robust optimization model that considers economic and environmental objective functions is constructed. Thirdly, the probability distribution set of renewable energy generation's uncertainty based on comprehensive norm constraint is defined, then the proposed model is processed based on strong duality theory and solved by Column & Constraint Generation and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithms to obtain the optimal scheduling scheme of IES, EV's energy management under coordinated operation, and trading strategy of multiple IESs. The results by a case study demonstrate that the proposed model makes the operating cost, grid interaction, and consumption rate of renewable energy of multiple IESs decrease by 5.86 %, 16.9 % and 5.9 %, respectively. Moreover, the degree of participation of EVs under cooperative operation is related to the role of corresponding IES in power trade.}

abstract = {The introduction of microgrids has enabled an efficient energy management in the system with installation of renewable energy sources. As one of the representative models of microgrid, various studies on campus microgrids (CMGs) have been conducted. In operation of CMG, various energy consumption resources and renewable energy are considered to minimize overall cost or peak power in the system. However, most of conventional researches only deal with performance analysis in terms of simulation by collecting data from the different environments. In this case, there are lack of consideration in power regulation or electricity cost which make it difficult to apply the researched energy operation technology to the actual power system. To solve the problem, this paper build a test-bed in an actual CMG environment and collect dataset through the various IoT sensors. In addition, uncertainties that occur through the various power resources are analyzed and used to derive net energy consumption scenarios. In this way, we propose a new cost optimal energy management model with the detailed analysis of power generation and consumption using various auxiliary IoT devices. Based on the real-world datasets from the implemented CMG, we show that the proposed analytical models and energy management model are feasible for actual environments. With satisfying the constraints, we show that the daily electricity cost could be reduced up to 2.16% and peak power is reduced up to 3% compared to the case without considering the uncertainties in CMG.}

The hybrid approach combines the Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) with density clustering and graph neural network (DCGNN), commonly referred to as the HBA-DCGNN method. The primary objective of the proposed method is to reduce customers' electricity costs while maintaining the desired level of comfort, such as interior temperature and appliance operation characteristics. The HBA algorithm optimizes power flow between the solar photovoltaic system, battery storage, and grid, while the DCGNN approach predicts solar PV power generation and energy demand in residential buildings. The proposed approach is done in MATLAB and is compared with the existing techniques, including the Random Forest Algorithm (RFA), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), and Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO). The outcome demonstrate that the proposed method lessens the costs of electricity by 1.12$ than the existing methods.}

abstract = {The integrated renewable energy resources (RERs) based smart grid in the power distribution network (PDN) has financial and ecological benefits. However, the emergence of RER-based microgrids and substations without real-time monitoring of their power parameters leads to various challenges in the PDN, such as suboptimal resource allocation, poor load management, grid instability, and lack of real-time decision-making capabilities. To mitigate these challenges, increase the system's visibility, and make efficient decisions, intelligent monitoring and control system is required for both smart grid and power substation. This proposed study develops IoT-based monitoring and control of power substations and associated distributed smart grids to make effective decisions of integration/segregation into the PDN. The proposed IoT-based integration/segregation of smart grids and load management can mitigate the stated challenges effectively. Using the HOMER Grid®, the research also investigates the annualized power production pattern of smart grids and the power consumption pattern of integrated loads to enable proactive decisions about energy management. The proposed study implements IoT technology for power parameters monitoring of substations and smart grids for their effective use, as it considers four types of load management, including industrial, domestic, commercial, and electric vehicles, with the aid of IoT technology to avoid power fluctuations and contingencies. Effective load management has been adopted based on annualized energy consumption, load patterns and real-time monitoring, and active decisions making. The results highlight that the proposed IoT-based approach helps advance smart grid integration into the PDN and enhance energy load management, consequently reducing energy costs and suppressing carbon emissions. The validation of the proposed model is verified by the constructed prototype, where the achieved real-time monitoring and control of power substations and smart grids into PDN is performed to make effective decisions related to energy and load management. Moreover, it effectively allows power distribution companies to manage loads during high demand or crises and enhances grid stability and energy efficiency.}

abstract = {In developing a sustainable and efficient power systems network while reducing carbon footprint, renewable energy (RE)-based Distribution Generation (DG) units are highly recommended. Furthermore, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and other passive electronic units are adopted to improve grid performance and mitigate the effects of high variability from RE power. Hence, planning frameworks are developed to optimally allocate these units to distribution networks. However, current planning mechanisms do not consider the relative effect of different allocated units in planning frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel comprehensive planning framework for allocating DG units, BESS units, and Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) facilities in a distribution network while optimizing its technical, economic, and environmental benefits. The proposed framework uses a recombination technique to generate more solutions by dynamically updating the DG and BESS units’ locations in one iteration. A Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithm is introduced to coordinate EV charging that suggests the optimal EVCS location in relation to other units’ locations. To cope with the complexity ensuing from searching a larger solution space, a multi-stage, hybrid optimization scheme is developed to produce optimal allocation variables. A category-based multiobjective framework is further developed to simultaneously optimize many objective functions — power loss, voltage stability, voltage deviation, installation and operation cost, and emission cost. Through numerical simulations on the IEEE 33- and 118-bus distribution network, it is shown that the proposed optimization scheme achieves higher metric values than the adopted benchmark optimization schemes. A validation process was also carried out on the proposed multiobjective optimization approach, comparing it with other approaches. Using the Spacing metric, the proposed approach proves to be efficient, depicting a good spread of Pareto optimal solutions.}

abstract = {The integrated exploitation of different energy infrastructures in the form of multi-energy systems (MESs) and the transformation of traditional prosumers into smart prosumers are two effective pathways to achieve net-zero emission energy systems in the near future. Managing different energy markets is one of the biggest challenges for the operators of MESs, since different carriers are traded in them simultaneously. Hence, this paper presents a hierarchical decentralized framework for the simultaneous management of electricity, heat and hydrogen markets among multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) integrated with smart prosumers. The market strategy of MEMGs is deployed using a hierarchical framework and considering the programs requested by smart prosumers. A deep learning-based forecaster is utilized to predict uncertain parameters while a risk-averse information gap decision theory (IGDT)-based strategy controls the scheduling risk. A new prediction-based mechanism for designing dynamic demand response (DR) schemes compatible with smart prosumers’ behavior is introduced, and the results illustrate that this mechanism reduces the electricity and heat clearing prices in peak hours by 17.5% and 8.78%, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that the introduced structure for hydrogen exchange through the transportation system has the ability to be implemented in competitive markets. Overall, the simulation results confirm that the proposed hierarchical model is able to optimally manage the competitive markets of electricity, heat and hydrogen by taking advantage of the potential of smart prosumers.}

In this paper, an advanced system-level EMS is proposed for residential AC/DC microgrids (MGs) by taking advantage of the innovations offered by digitalization. The proposed EMS supports green transition as it is designed for an MG that includes renewable energy sources (RESs), batteries, and electric vehicles. In addition, the electricity consumption behaviors of residential users have been automatically extracted to create a more flexible MG. Deep learning-supported Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithm is deployed to analyze and disaggregate the aggregated consumption signal of each household in the MG. A two-level EMS is designed that coordinates both households and MG components using optimization, forecasting, and NILM modules. The proposed system-level EMS has been tested in a laboratory environment in real-time. Experiments are performed considering different optimization periods and the effectiveness of the proposed EMS has been shown for different optimization horizons. Compared to a peak shaving strategy as a benchmark, the proposed EMS for 24-hour horizon provides a 12.36% reduction in the residential MG daily operation cost.}

abstract = {Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approaches are at the forefront of contemporary research in optimum electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling challenges. These techniques involve multiple agents that respond to a dynamic simulation environment to strategically integrate EV charging stations (EVCSs) on microgrids by incorporating the constraints posed by stochastic trip durations. In addition, recent research works have demonstrated that planning frameworks based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques are suitable for the efficient functioning of microgrids comprising renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Even though MADRL techniques have been used to solve the optimum EV charging scheduling challenges and MOO frameworks have been developed to determine the optimal RES-BESS allocation, the potential of merging MADRL and MOO is yet to be explored. Therefore, this research provides an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of combined MOO-MADRL dynamics and their computational efficacy. In this context, this work presents a novel Multi-objective Artificial Vultures Optimization Algorithm based on Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MOAVOA-MADDPG) planning framework for allocating RESs, BESSs, and EVCSs on microgrids. The objective function is formulated to optimize the network power losses, total installation and operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and system voltage stability. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates the sporadic nature of RES systems and intends to improve the state of charge (SOC) of the EVs present in the network. The presented approach is validated using practical weather data and EV commuting behavior on the modified IEEE 33 bus network, two practical distribution feeders in Bangladesh, and the Turkish 141 bus network. According to the findings, the MOAVOA-MADDPG framework effectively accommodated the financial, technical, and environmental considerations with improved average SOC of the vehicles. Furthermore, statistical analysis, spacing, convergence, and hyper-volume metrics are employed to compare the suggested MOAVOA-MADDPG framework with five contemporary techniques. The findings indicate that, in every metric considered, the MOAVOA-MADDPG Pareto fronts provide superior solutions.}
